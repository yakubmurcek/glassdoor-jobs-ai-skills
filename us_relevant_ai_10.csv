This means making bold decisions and building systems that support not only fleets but the broader economy. It all starts with enabling commercial vehicles to keep rolling with seamless toll management, weigh station bypass, and safety solutions. It’s what we do best, and we do it to meet the demands of the road every day.
That’s why people join us: our solutions are implemented in real-time, on highways and interstates across the nation, helping fleets go farther, faster.

Engage in code reviews and mob programming sessions focused on readability, performance, and security
Partner with product owners driving discussions on architecture, quality, and delivery timelines
Mentorship & Team Support
Mentor less experienced engineers by modeling good coding practices and sharing knowledge
Contribute to team discussions on design, scalability, and long-term maintainability
Encourage thoughtful use of modern development tools including GitHub Copilot and Cursor
Requirements

We are a well-backed Healthtech company and the nation’s largest healthcare consulting firm. We help hospitals, health clinics, and surgery centers to run their business more effectively through a self-managed, consultative partnership, which makes the practice much easier and more efficient.
Who You Are:
You like to work on all parts of your projects from beginning to end and get as much satisfaction from continually improving something as you do from starting something new.
You’re able to take a set of project requirements — or even a well-described idea— and turn it into a working product without much (if any) assistance.
You mostly develop for the web but are interested in branching out to other areas (native application development? AI/ML? UI/UX? etc.) and value the opportunity to do so.
You’re not intimidated by challenges and welcome the opportunity to participate in all phases of software development as needed.
You’re comfortable working cross-functionally with different teams and departments (both technical and non-technical).
Responsibilities:
The key responsibility of this position is to develop end-to-end solutions for our clients and for internal use. You will be working with a small group of developers and project managers, and be joining a team that is tasked with building the systems that will take us into our third decade.
Write front-end and back-end code with a solid grasp of SDLC best practices (we use PHP)
Use a framework to create performant, reliable HTTP-based APIs (we use Laravel).
Wire API’s to a modern front-end framework (we use Vue.js)
Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, and understand the importance of test-driven development.

Diffit is an AI-powered instructional materials platform designed to help teachers do their best work more sustainably. Teachers use Diffit to get “just right” classroom activities, saving time and helping all students access grade-level content. Come join a growing remote-first and mission-focused AI edtech company to build quality, safe and affordable educational resources for teachers and students.
The Role
At Diffit, engineers work closely with Product and Design to build thoughtful, high-impact features for teachers. We’re a small, full-stack team, so you'll work across the stack (React on the frontend, Python/Flask on the backend) to ship end-to-end functionality. Beyond feature work, you’ll help shape our architecture, improve internal tooling, and contribute to a platform that tens of thousands of teachers rely on every day. We move quickly, learn constantly, and stay focused on delivering real value to teachers.
Responsibilities
Drive Projects End-to-End
Engineers at Diffit own their work from kickoff through launch and beyond. That means designing, implementing, testing, and monitoring your features. It means being thoughtful about how your work fits into the bigger picture. You'll regularly move high-impact initiatives forward, not just tickets. (Senior engineers are expected to take on larger projects with significantly more ambiguity.)
Product-Oriented Thinking
We all care deeply about the teachers we serve. Engineers are expected to think critically about user needs, provide input on product decisions, and ensure our technical solutions actually solve real problems. You’ll collaborate closely with product, design, and support to stay grounded in what matters most.
Communicate with Clarity and Candor
Communication is a core part of engineering. You’ll explain tradeoffs, share progress, give and receive feedback, and collaborate across disciplines. We value clarity, curiosity, and a willingness to ask the hard questions early.
Contribute to a Supportive Team
We believe great teams are built on trust and shared responsibility. That means helping unblock others, pitching in when workloads are uneven, and treating teammates with respect and kindness.
Work Autonomously with Velocity
We move fast: not by cutting corners, but by staying focused. Engineers at Diffit are self-directed and tenacious. Tasks typically have a single owner, and it’s up to you to drive them forward with speed, pragmatism, and attention to quality.
Continuously Improve and Learn
We expect engineers to grow and to help others grow. That might mean learning a new tool, reflecting on a mistake, mentoring a teammate, or revising how we work together. Curiosity and humility go a long way.
Requirements
