Diffit is an AI-powered instructional materials platform designed to help teachers do their best work more sustainably. Teachers use Diffit to get “just right” classroom activities, saving time and helping all students access grade-level content. Come join a growing remote-first and mission-focused AI edtech company to build quality, safe and affordable educational resources for teachers and students.
The Role
At Diffit, engineers work closely with Product and Design to build thoughtful, high-impact features for teachers. We’re a small, full-stack team, so you'll work across the stack (React on the frontend, Python/Flask on the backend) to ship end-to-end functionality. Beyond feature work, you’ll help shape our architecture, improve internal tooling, and contribute to a platform that tens of thousands of teachers rely on every day. We move quickly, learn constantly, and stay focused on delivering real value to teachers.
Responsibilities
Drive Projects End-to-End
Engineers at Diffit own their work from kickoff through launch and beyond. That means designing, implementing, testing, and monitoring your features. It means being thoughtful about how your work fits into the bigger picture. You'll regularly move high-impact initiatives forward, not just tickets. (Senior engineers are expected to take on larger projects with significantly more ambiguity.)
Product-Oriented Thinking
We all care deeply about the teachers we serve. Engineers are expected to think critically about user needs, provide input on product decisions, and ensure our technical solutions actually solve real problems. You’ll collaborate closely with product, design, and support to stay grounded in what matters most.
Communicate with Clarity and Candor
Communication is a core part of engineering. You’ll explain tradeoffs, share progress, give and receive feedback, and collaborate across disciplines. We value clarity, curiosity, and a willingness to ask the hard questions early.
Contribute to a Supportive Team
We believe great teams are built on trust and shared responsibility. That means helping unblock others, pitching in when workloads are uneven, and treating teammates with respect and kindness.
Work Autonomously with Velocity
We move fast: not by cutting corners, but by staying focused. Engineers at Diffit are self-directed and tenacious. Tasks typically have a single owner, and it’s up to you to drive them forward with speed, pragmatism, and attention to quality.
Continuously Improve and Learn
We expect engineers to grow and to help others grow. That might mean learning a new tool, reflecting on a mistake, mentoring a teammate, or revising how we work together. Curiosity and humility go a long way.

IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee’s monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee’s salary.
Profit Sharing Plan (PSP)
The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds quarterly on the employee’s behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee’s compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.
Stock Options
Because Northstrat is an employee-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company.
Lifelong Learning
Our culture promotes and nurtures a growth environment. We hire and scale rapidly to meet the needs of our partner customers. Through periodic company sponsored training events, and the ability to use IBA funds for reimbursement of work-related education expenses you will have the opportunity to continually grow your skills and abilities.
Join Our Talented Team

For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend.

Pathfinders, a full-service integrated marketing agency, is looking for a Full Stack Developer who can build, connect, and maintain the digital products our clients rely on. At Pathfinders, developers aren’t just coders; they’re problem solvers who turn business goals into reliable, scalable, and high-performing digital experiences.
In this role, you’ll work across the stack: building responsive interfaces, writing clean back-end code, integrating APIs, and owning testing and QA before launch. You’ll also keep existing sites healthy with ongoing maintenance, security updates, and performance tuning. Collaboration is key: you’ll partner with designers, strategists, and account leads to ensure our work not only looks great but also functions seamlessly across systems.
This role is a great fit for someone who enjoys balancing front-end creativity with back-end logic, who gets just as much satisfaction from solving API challenges or database issues as from launching a site that delights clients.
And because we value curiosity, in the final application question, tell us your favorite framework, library, or digital tool (and why). We’re looking for developers who bring ideas and perspective, not just code.
You might be a great fit if you:
: You bring energy and clarity into every conversation. Even when things get tough, you make work feel doable, not draining.
Set the Tone
: You don’t just check boxes. You make sure the work connects to the bigger goal and moves projects forward.
Own the Outcome
: You stay curious, adapt quickly when things change, and see every challenge as a chance to get better.
Keep Growing
: You believe great work is a team sport. You give credit generously, assume positive intent, and celebrate shared wins.

CAD, Software deployment, Math, Data science, TypeScript;"About Us
Our mission is to electrify the world’s homes for healthy and sustainable living. Residential electrification is an extraordinary decarbonization opportunity - 145 million homes in the United States account for 20% of our climate emissions. But today electrification is painful - it’s too complicated, time consuming, and expensive. So we’re building a new experience for homeowners, contractors, and utilities. Zero bridges the gap between the digital and the physical with a frictionless experience that makes electrification fast, easy, and affordable. Join our team to build a world class consumer experience that just so happens to electrify America.
About the Role & Your Impact
This is an exciting opportunity for those with 1-3 years of professional experience to join an early stage company of talented engineers and designers, led by seasoned climate tech veterans. We are looking for candidates with outstanding potential and serious work ethic. If you want to spend the next 5 years of your career learning and growing faster than you can imagine, and you are eager to put in the long hours necessary, Zero is the place for you. Junior Engineers work in small teams (1 designer and 1-2 programmers) in six-week cycles to take well defined projects and improve existing features. You will be given ample access to coaching, mentoring, and collaboration across the team, but will also be expected to operate effectively with minimal oversight. We are relentlessly focused on sustainable productivity. You should expect long stretches of deep work, no standing meetings, effective in person collaboration with stakeholders and peers, as well as flexibility around your personal life.
The products we build serve a diverse range of customers: homeowners, contractors, and utilities, as well as the Zero employees that support these customers. Examples include a CAD application that designs HVAC and energy efficiency projects, our soon to be launched website refresh, and web apps that allow contractors and utilities to review and approve jobs. These products are built using Nuxt, Typescript & Tailwind, but no one on our team had experience with that complete stack before joining, and we don’t expect you to either. No matter what product you are working on, the code you write will be directly responsible for deploying millions of dollars into safer, healthier, and more cost-effective homes.
What You Bring
You want to do big things, and you want to join a team that will teach you how. You are ambitious, hard working, and hungry for growth. You have high standards for yourself, and your team. You are relentless in the face of challenges, and recognize that the only path to excellence is through failure.
You are a detail-oriented systems thinker. You want to learn how to own the whole product, not just isolated features. You always anchor your work on user needs and seek to understand how users operate in a larger context. You may not have experience in climate tech or building science, but you are eager to dive into the messy world of residential electrification.
You have an eye for elegance - the confluence of beauty, effectiveness, and simplicity - and there are early signs that you can build elegant digital experiences from the ground up. You value functional beauty in the physical world, and you are excited to build software that will create healthy, comfortable, and sustainable living spaces for our customers.
You are a pragmatic team player. You know that products only matter if they ship, and are an effective collaborator with product designers and senior engineers. You want lots of freedom, but you know that comes with the responsibility to communicate and deliver. You are humble, kind and coachable.
You are enthusiastic about in-person work. You want to know your users by name, meet them in person, and you want to see them smile when they use your designs. You live within 50 miles of Denver, CO or are willing to relocate.
